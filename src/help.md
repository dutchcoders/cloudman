Cloudman 0.1.7
----------
Cloudman is a textual user interface (heavily inspired by htop) to manage your Amazon EC2 fleet instantly. By using Cloudman you'll find an overview of your instances, navigate through regions, retrieve instance details, show console outputs and connect to instance terminal using SSM.

The profiles and defaults as configured in ~/.aws/credentials will be used.
